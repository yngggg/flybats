# flybats
Game made on pygame, game is not completed, and is used as an experience in developing games on pygame and is a demo version with a full overview of the functionality of pygame  In this game you play as a magician (player class), your weapon is a spell (bullet class), your rivals are cursed bats (class orang, mobs, sukl, diabl) there is also an unrealized boss, I gave him the functionality of a bat, especially he differs in his behavior in the game, instead of attacking the player with his body, he must shoot him with his eye, he was not implemented due to the fact that I was offered another project, and I will return to this later  Those who want to try it can always do it, the code is in the public domain
